As an enthusiastic data explorer, I recognized the opportunity to sharpen my SQL skills and delve into the intriguing world of data analysis. The bookstore database contained a wealth of information, including details about books, authors, customers, orders, and more.

Bestsellers Unveiled: To discover the bestsellers, I determined the top 5 books with the highest sales quantities. This involved joining tables and crunching numbers to unearth valuable insights.
Loyalty in Numbers: I delved into customer loyalty by identifying patrons who placed at least 3 orders. This insight was a testament to the bookstore's dedicated customer base.
Genre Analysis: Calculating the average book prices per genre gave me a deeper understanding of reading preferences and potential market trends.
High Roller Discovery: I found the customer who had spent the most on orders, showcasing a unique perspective on customer engagement.
